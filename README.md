# Pokémon Team Builder
Pokémon Team Builder is a web application that allows you to plan your Pokémon team and view your team's strengths and weaknesses for your Pokémon gameplays.
## Background
Pokémon is a franchise owned by Nintendo and Game Freak that is widely known for their game series. In the games, you play as a trainer who can catch, train, and battle other trainers with creatures known as Pokémon. Each Pokémon can be one or two types and are strong or weak against other Pokémon based on type matchups. In addition, as a trainer, you are able to have up to six Pokémon on your team. With so many Pokémon to choose from, there are countless combinations of Pokémon teams for your playthrough.
